### Using material-ui package

We are using the [markoshust:material-ui](https://atmospherejs.com/markoshust/material-ui) package, which uses `material-ui` React component library from NPM.

### TODO
-[ ] Add react component whose image data element can be updated with a tag, use state to keep track of this, or just change the dom element letting the user know the image is attached, that would be much easier
- [ ] I think I was trying to get a single outcome to generate on the full screen, seems like I was able to pass in the outcome ID along with a route change, need to reuse the "new.jsx" to show the outcome
- [ ] Continue working on single 'condition/symptom' overlay
- [ ] Call outcomes a "case" instead of outcome
