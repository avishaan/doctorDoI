# Material UI Leaderboard

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor/react-packages/master/examples/material-ui-leaderboard/screenshot.png" width="400">

This is an example of building the leaderboard app using React and the [Material UI](http://material-ui.com/) components library.

### Using material-ui package

We are using the [markoshust:material-ui](https://atmospherejs.com/markoshust/material-ui) package, which uses `material-ui` React component library from NPM.

### TODO
-[ ] Add react component whose image data element can be updated with a tag, use state to keep track of this, or just change the dom element letting the user know the image is attached, that would be much easier
- [ ] I think I was trying to get a single outcome to generate on the full screen, seems like I was able to pass in the outcome ID along with a route change, need to reuse the "new.jsx" to show the outcome
